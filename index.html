 			Luchi (Bengali: লুচি) is a deep-fried flatbread, made of Maida flour, originating from the Bengal region. Luchi is especially popular in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura and in the neighbouring country Bangladesh. It is notably eaten with aloor dum or kosha mangsho. Since Luchi does not involve rice or rice flour, it is a popular staple item at times when rice is to be avoided,as in case of ekadashi, for those who believe in the ritual, or similar instances. In such ritualistic instances, since the primary food needs to be vegetarian, Luchi is preferred with dum aloo or any similar vegetarian dish. In occasions where no such restriction is mandated, luchi and kosha mangsho is often a popular combination.

 			Kachori is supposed to have originated in Uttar Pradesh, India. In these states it is usually a round flattened ball made of fine flour filled with a stuffing of baked mixture of yellow moong dal or urad dal (crushed and washed horse beans), besan (crushed and washed gram flour), black pepper, red chili powder, salt and other spices.

            Banarasidas, the author of biographical Ardhakathanaka, has mentioned buying Kachoris in Indore in 1613.[3] For seven months, he bought a ser of Kachoris daily, and owed twenty rupees.

 			Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas.

			Fuchka (or fuska or puska) differs from Panipuri in content and taste. It uses spiced mashed potatoes as the filling. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.
